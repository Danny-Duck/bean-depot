# The Bean Depot ‚òïÔ∏è

The Bean Depot aims to solve a problem of distance between coffee producers and coffee enthusiasts. This two sided marketplace breaks down the geographical barriers with an online platform created for both the consumer and producer, empowering each to find and share the coffee they love.

Traditionally enthusiasts would be restricted to local coffee bean producers, purchasing through a physical coffee shop or directly. Limiting both parties to their local area. The Bean Depot allows coffee to be bought and sold anywhere there is internet and postal services.
